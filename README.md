## General info

This project was made to put into practice everything that I know until now.

I learned a lot of things from this project such as: <br>
* The difference between relative and absolute positions. <br>
* How to use z-index to stack an element above another. <br>
* The importance of color contrast. <br>
* How to create a parallax scrolling effect. <br>
* How to create a sticky and responsive navigation bar. <br>

Completing this project wasn't hard but very time-consuming, but I'm happy with the final result.<br>
I'm looking forward to learning more things with the next project.
