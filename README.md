## General info

I made this project to put into practice everything that I know until now.

I learned a lot of things from this project such as: <br>
* The difference between relative and absolute positions. <br>
* How to use z-index to stack an element above another. <br>
* The importance of color contrast. <br>
* Create a parallax scrolling effect. <br>
* Create a sticky and responsive navigation bar. <br>
* Use npm to install packages. <br>

This was the first time that I have used SASS and HTML5 Boilerplate.<br> 
I did a basic usage of it but just being able to nest classes with SASS is awesome.<br>
I'll tinker around with it to learn how to use it properly for future projects.


Completing this project wasn't hard but very time-consuming, but I'm happy with the result. I'm looking forward to learning more things with the next project.
