## General info

I did this project to put into practice everything I have learned so far.

The site was written from scratch and the design was taken from [this template](https://colorlib.com/wp/template/oneschool/). <br> I have improved and added a few things to make it more visually appealing.

I learned a lot of things with this project: <br>
* The difference between relative and absolute positions. <br>
* How to use z-index to stack an element above another. <br>
* The importance of color contrast. <br>
* How to create a parallax scrolling effect. <br>
* How to create a sticky and responsive navigation bar. <br>
* How to use npm to install packages. <br>
* How to use SASS (being able to nest classes is awesome)

Finishing this project wasn't difficult, but I spent a lot of time writing CSS, so I'll try to use a CSS framework next time.
<br>
<br>
I hope to learn more things with the next project.
